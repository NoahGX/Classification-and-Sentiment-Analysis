# Classification and Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is designed for the classification and sentiment analysis of poker hands using machine learning models. It utilizes various libraries in Python to preprocess data, construct models, and evaluate their performance.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Identification and removal of duplicates and handling missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Using seaborn and matplotlib for graphical representation of data distributions and correlations.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of logistic regression and deep learning models using TensorFlow.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Calculation of metrics such as MAE, MSE, and confusion matrices.

## Usage
- Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
- Run the cells sequentially to observe each step from data loading to model evaluation.
- Modify hyperparameters or models as needed to experiment with different machine learning techniques.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn

## Input
- **Poker Hand Dataset**: Ensure the dataset is downloaded and accessible to the notebook.
- **Hotel Reviews Dataset**: Obtain the dataset via the Kaggle API or by direct download.

## Output
Outputs include various statistical summaries, visualizations, and performance metrics of the models. Model predictions are also shown as outputs for test data.

## Notes
- The random seed is set for reproducibility.
- Ensure all required libraries are installed before running the notebook.
- The dataset URL is hardcoded; ensure internet access or modify the path with a local copy of the dataset.
